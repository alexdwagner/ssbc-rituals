# Readme Swarm

Happy0 feel free to rename this file (and the link in README) this is a total placeholder.

I reckon you should write down roughly what you did and then nanomonkey can tweak it and improve it when he runs it in the following week?

prompts:
  - what is this?
  - what are the rules?
  - how does it work?
  - how is it accessible?
  - who's the host?
  - how do we know when it's closed?
