# Contributor calls

This is deliberately patchy, it's an invitiation to notice and improve, play along ! 

What does a good invitaiton look like?
  How do we make it more accessible?
  What tools help out and what are they for? e.g. gatherings, mumble, hackmd, doodle

What's the point? 

How long is it?

What's a good body of the ritual look like? 
  - there are probably many... depends on the point of the call right?
  -does it depend on how many people come?


People who have set up and run calls:
  - Soapdog
  - Mikey
  - Mix
  - ...
(is it useful to collect this for anything?)
