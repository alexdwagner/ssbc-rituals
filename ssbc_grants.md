# SSBC Grants

This is deliberately patchy, it's an invitiation to notice and improve, play along ! 


Thoughts:
  - There's a monthly process ... I think it is based on some grants.md and some informal practices that have emerged.
  - Did we ever agree on nany roles?
  - who's run it ?
  - what tools have we used?
  - what does the invitation look like?
  - how do we notice the vibe?
